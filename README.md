# frechet_video_distance_calculation
calculate FVD (frechet video distance)

This code is from [MVCD model project](https://github.com/voletiv/mcvd-pytorch), I've just extracted the part of it that's relevant to the FVD calculation. This code can be used to evaluate FVD scores for new generative models.
